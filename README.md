# Golf Course Tournament Pace Simulation Model
A golf course simulation model that replicates the real-life random nature of golf course operations and the time discrepancies that form as a result. This project displays the overall function of time management in a tournament setting. Designed and built in the Python language, the program utilizes the simpy framework to run a simulation of a tournament to most closely mimic that of real-world scenarios to better study time discrepancies and course efficiency.  

## Installations
Since the program is only existent end-to-end within the Python console, it is recommended for the best experience, that you install an IDE such as PyCharm (the native IDE used for the development of this program) or another IDE that works well with Python like Visual Studio Code.

#### Precautionary Note:

Be sure to have the latest version of Python Installed on your OS.
### Simpy Installation
Within the IDE (PyCharm), find the "Python Packages" tab (this will be the second option down in the lower column of options on the left side toolbar) to navigate to the packages download interface. Here you will simply search "simpy" and the package will appear. It is best to download the newest version (ver. 4.1.1).

OR

Within another IDE, find the menu to download packages in Python and search for the "simpy" package as previously mentioned in the PyCharm instructions. Install (ver. 4.1.1).

OR

Within the terminal using pip:

> $ pip install simpy

### Numpy Installation
Within the IDE(PyCharm), find the "Python Packages" tab (this will be the second option down in the lower column of options on the left side toolbar) to navigate to the packages download interface. Here you will simply search "numpy" and the package will appear. It is best to download the latest version.

OR

Within another IDE, find the menu to download packages in Python and search for the "numpy" package, then download and install.

OR

Within the terminal using pip:

> $ pip install numpy

### Project Installation and Setup

To install the project directly from the GitHub website:
1. Navigate to the "<> Code" dropdown above.
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Once the ZIP has been downloaded, open and prepare your IDE by performing the necessary installations (simpy and numpy packages) above.
4. Find the option to open an existing project within your ide.
5. Navigate to the directory in which the project has downloaded (.../mod-sim-Proj-master.zip).
6. Once located, open the zip into the IDE.
7. The complete project will be opened into your IDE for execution.
8. When ready to execute, navigate the "Run" button in your designated IDE to compile and execute the program. The main execution file will be the mod_sim.py file. The output of the project will appear within the console.

OR 

To download in terminal (after downloading git) use

> git clone https://github.com/amill0156/mod-sim-Proj

to manually create a copy of the project on your local machine.

## Simulation Run Requirements
For the most accurate representation of results, be sure the group_start_delay variable is representative of 8 time units (minutes). This is representative of real-world data and is the baseline time utilized in all of the data studied in the final project package.

### This simulation requires:

 -  Windows 10 or later
 -  Latest version of Python
 -  Simpy framework installation
 -  Numpy package installation

### Optional dependencies:

 - pip
 - Git
