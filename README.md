For this project I will be implementing a model and providing a simulation of that model based upon the pace of play of a golf course and how to keep track of the groups that get deployed to the golf course via the first hole. The plan to implement this is to utilize the python language with the simpy framework/package and use a queueing strucuture and threads in order to time the periods of time that it takes to complete a hole of golf. The goal of the implementation is to show a close representation of the pace of play model on a golf course and how the model works or possibly could be improved in the real world.
